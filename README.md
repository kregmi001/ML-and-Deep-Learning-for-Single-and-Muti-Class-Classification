# Project: Machine and Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Dataset: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
### Project takes on three core tasks listed below:
- Movie recommender using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine similarity
- usage of TF-IDF vectorizer on Machine Learning Models for single text classification (top genre)
- usage of Count Vectorizer on Keras Sequential Model for multi-text classification ( All relevant genres)
